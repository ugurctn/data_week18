# Citibike Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes Citibike ride data from the years 2020 and 2023. The goal is to extract insights from the dataset using Python and visualize key metrics with Tableau.

## Files in the Project
- **2020_citibike_sample.csv**: A sample dataset of Citibike rides from 2020.
- **2023_citibike_sample.csv**: A sample dataset of Citibike rides from 2023.
- **Sample Citibike Tableau Data.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that processes and prepares the Citibike data for analysis and visualization.

## Project Goals
- Clean and preprocess Citibike ride data.
- Identify trends and patterns over time.
- Prepare data for visualization in Tableau.

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- Tableau for creating interactive dashboards.

## How to Use
1. Open `Sample Citibike Tableau Data.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook to process and clean the dataset.
3. Export the processed data for further analysis in Tableau.
4. Use Tableau to create visualizations and uncover insights.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset to include additional years.
- Implement machine learning models to predict ride patterns.
- Automate data updates with APIs.
